      'Implemented a dynamic, input dependent filter approximation and selection technique to improve the computational efficiency of deep neural networks. The approximation techniques convert 32 bit floating point filter weights in the convolutional and fully connected layers of the network into smaller precision values. This is done by reducing the number of bits used to represent the weights.',

      'Built an Augmented Reality App called 16 Squares of Blacksburg in C# and designed on Unity using Vuforia SDK to demonstrate the history of Blacksburg. Using 3D object models of 50+ buildings, the app was aimed to be an used as an educational tool where users could click on a building to get information about it along with a variety of interaction techniques like pinch to zoom, slide to rotate etc.',
